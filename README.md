Door is Locked for Everyone
===========================

Door is Locked for Everyone is a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) add-on
module that sends the "door is locked" sound played when a player clicks on a
locked door to every connected client.

While Foundry VTT 11 already plays the door open and close sounds on every
connected client, it doesn't do so for the door locked sound. [This is
apparently a deliberate design decision on Foundry VTT's part](https://github.com/foundryvtt/foundryvtt/issues/9937).
I disagree with that decision, so this module fixed that behaviour.
